_**This project was assigned by university as a practical way to learn about embedded systems and baremetal programming.**_

**Project Requirements**
* Use only standard C libraries
* Use a range of the onboard peripherals (LCD, ADC, DAC, USART, TIMERS, LEDS, BUTTONS, LDR, BUZZER etc). 
* The game must be created individually using “bare metal” programming using Keil. 
* The C code for each peripheral should be contained in a separate, appropriately named, .c file with associated header, .h, file that contain header guards, definitions and function declaration. 
* The main routine should initialise and call the appropriate functions in a structured routine to implement the game. 
* Comments should inform a non-programmer the purpose of the code and any algorithms used to accomplish the goal or overall operation. 
* You should aim to create self-documenting code using well-chosen variable names and function names to make the code read as close to
English as possible.
