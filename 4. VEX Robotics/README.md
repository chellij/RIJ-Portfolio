Although I have no code or examples to show as it was a few years ago, VEX Robotics was the starting point for me being interested in robotics and so I thought it important to
include in my portfolio. VEX Robotics is one of the largest robotics programes and competitions for students. Teams are required to design, build, program, and drive a robot to complete the challenge as best as they can. The first year I took part in this competition, our school had never competed before and my teachers came to me and asked me to find a few other technical and STEM minded girls to form an all-girls team. Although none of us had done anything like it before we applied for funding from Girls into Stem and got stuck into the project.

2016 - Nothing But Net 

The competition basis in 2016 was to design and build a Robot using VEX parts and the VEX version of C that would be able to pick up balls in an arena and throw them into a nets at the corners of the pitch. We managed to win our regional competition and made it through to Nationals at the NEC in Birmingham where we won the Most Spirited Team award.

I have linked the website we created at the time and included some
photographs of our robot and the competition.
