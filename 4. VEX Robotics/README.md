Although I have no code or examples to show as it was a few years ago, VEX Robotics was
the starting point for me being interested in robotics and so I thought it important to
include in my portfolio. I have linked the website we created at the time and included some
photographs of our robot and the competition.
The competition basis was to design and build a Robot using VEX parts and the VEX version
of C that would be able to pick up balls in an arena and throw them into a net. We won
regionals and made it through to Nationals at the NEC in Birmingham where we won the
Most Spirited Team award.
