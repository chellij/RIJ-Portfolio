Hi I am Rachel! I am a second-year student at the univeristy of Plymouth studying a 4 year integrated masters and currently looking for a placement year for the next academic year. I was first introduced to robotics at school and after a research project in physics about prosthetics I realised I wanted to focus on humanoid robotics or medical robotics.
