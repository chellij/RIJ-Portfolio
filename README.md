Hi I am Rachel! I am a second-year student at the univeristy of Plymouth studying a 4 year integrated masters and currently looking for a placement year for the next academic year. I was first introduced to robotics at school and after a research project in physics about prosthetics I realised I wanted to focus on humanoid robotics or medical robotics. 

# My Portfolio

Although I am at the beginning of my career in Robotics I have included a few projects in this repository to show some of my skills in electrical and robotic engineering. 
Some of these projects were completed as part of my academic learning and some are hobbies and self-taught skills. I have includes overviews of each project as readme files, code, photos and videos where applicable.
