*This was a group project that was set by university using an STM32F429ZI Nucleo
Development board as the basis for a buggy that should push beads over a line. Due to
COVID-19, we were not able to finish the project in a practical sense as we could not access
the labs to 3D print or laser cut the components of our design. However my group and I
were ahead of the majority of the class and so decided to continue our design and finish
the CAD model. I have included a link to the public access of this model and my final report
of the project to show the practical work that was completed.*
